# Water-quality-forecasting
The project created in the scope of Machine Learning course 2021 University of Hamburg

71% of Earth is cover by water, however only 3% is a fresh water, out of which only 1% is readily-available. There are multiple causes of water pollution, like rapid urban development, agricultureoil spills, etc.
This project aims to predict the quality of water based on Water Quality Index for a data collected from 22 stations on Southern Bug river.

There were two prediction approaches explored: Linear regression and LSTM. The first one recieved RMSE score of 15.37 and R2 score of 0.58, the latter got 18.20 and 0.37 respectively.

For the future work it might be beneficial to try explore more parameters and different techniques for time series forecasting.
